      <h3>Pregnancy & Birth Plan Consultation: $60 for 2 hours</h3>
      <p>
        Navigating pregnancy and forming a birth plan can be overwhelming and
        confusing, lets chat about your goals and what you are desiring for this
        baby! This session can look like whatever you want it to be, but some
        common topics we discuss are: determining where you want to give birth,
        finding a care provider that aligns with your goals, discussing
        different pain management options, discussing childbirth education
        classes, discussing interventions, connecting you to resources, and so
        much more. This time is for you, so I encourage you to bring your birth
        partner and come with questions!
      </p>

        Some insurances will cover parts or all of your doula services (check
        this out lol) and I am happy to discuss payment plans if needed. I am a
        doula because I love what I do, so please reach out if you are wanting
        to discuss different payment options.
