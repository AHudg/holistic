        <p>
          Doula is the professional name for someone who is your supportâ€”
          educationally, mentally, emotionally, and at times physically! There
          are two types of doulas: birth doulas and postpartum doulas. I am a
          certified birth doula who is excited to walk alongside you through
          your pregnancy and labor. My passion is to provide education to help
          make informed decisions regarding your birth plan. Pregnancy and labor
          can be overwhelming, and no one should have to sift through the
          information alone. Doulas work with your partner to create an
          environment where you feel safe, comfortable, and in charge of your
          birth.

        <h2 className="italics">Why a Doula?</h2>
        <p>
          Research has shown that having a doula in your birth can decrease your
          stress during pregnancy and positively impact the labor process.
          Doulas make a great advocate for birth plans and are on your team.
          Doulas can offer that extra support to make your birth experience that
          much more enjoyable and ensure that you feel empowered and prepared
          for birth. Whether you are a first time mom or are looking for a
          different birth experience, doulas are here to help you through
          pregnancy and labor.
          <br /> <br />
          Doulas can help to decrease your chances of ending up in a cesarean
          section, to avoid complications during birth, to lessen the risk of
          instrumental vaginal deliveries, and to decrease likelihood of
          dissatisfaction with the birth experience.
